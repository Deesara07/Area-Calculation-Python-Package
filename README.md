# Shapes and Objects Area Calculation Python Package

This Python package simplifies area calculations for 2D shapes and the surface area of 3D objects. 

## Features

- Calculate areas for common 2D shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, square).
- Compute surface areas for 3D objects (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, cuboid).
- Combine areas of multiple shapes or objects for total area calculations.

## Installation

```bash
pip install area-calc-python
